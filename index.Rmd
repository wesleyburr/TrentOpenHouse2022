## Department of Mathematics

* in the Sciences, under Dean Hintelmann
* 10 faculty in areas ranging from algebra, analysis and discrete math to
finance, statistics, applied math
* housed with Gzowski College in Enwaayang (3rd floor)

## Degrees

* BSc in Mathematical Economics (joint MATH/ECON) or in Mathematical Physics (joint MATH/PHYS)
<br />
* BSc in Mathematics (single-major, dual-major honours; single-major, dual-major general; minor)
  * Specializations in Mathematical Finance or Statistics (all MATH)
<br />  
* BSc in Financial Science (joint MATH/ADMN/ECON)

## The First Year

In your first year, regardless of which of the above paths you take,
there are four required courses:

* MATH 1110H - Calculus I
* MATH 1120H - Calculus II
* MATH 1350H - Linear Algebra I: Matrix Algebra
* MATH 1550H - Probability I: Introduction to Probability

In addition, there are two courses, MATH 1051H and 1052H, on non-calculus
statistics, which are optional and do not count toward any of the above degrees.

## The Second Year

In your second year, things start to change, based on your program. Most
of the streams and programs will still take:

* MATH 2110H - Calculus III
* MATH 2120H - Calculus IV
* MATH 2150H - Ordinary Differential Equations (not *required* for Mathematics majors)
* MATH 2200H - Mathematical Reasoning (not for Mathematical Physics)
* MATH 2350H - Linear Algebra II: Vector Spaces
* MATH 2560H - Statistics I: Applied Statistics

class: inverse

## Upper Years

Once you reach upper-year, aside from the requirement that you take a certain
number of courses, your choices are almost unlimited. You may specialize in
any two of the following if you like, or simply take a selection of courses:

* Algebra
* Analysis
* Discrete Mathematics
* Statistics
* Applied Mathematics
* Finance

The only required course is for the BSc Mathematics (Honours) program, which has a 
mandatory 4th year course: MATH 4800H, which is a thesis project.

## Department Culture

* small, friendly, welcoming
* Student Help Center is a great hub
* lots of open doors, you *will* get to know your professors

* second-year classes of size 40-60
* third- and fourth-year classes range from 10-30

## Internships and Co-ops

* new Internship course available for the BSc in Mathematics - Summers, 3rd and 4th year
* new co-op stream available for the BSc in Financial Science - Summer of 2nd year,
Summer of 3rd year, and Fall of 4th year
* opportunities for working as a grader or lab demonstrator for the department,
as well as Student Help Center representative
* community research projects and thesis projects for hands-on learning

## New and Exciting

* Bloomberg Lab to be launched for Fall 2022
* experiential learning opportunities; certificate possibility
* integrated data management and collection into Mathematical Finance, Statistics,
and Financial Science options
